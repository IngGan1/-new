 fee_KOR.3.d: "During the rise of the Joseon dynasty, the neo-Confusian scholar Gil Jae had retreated to his home town, where he educated a generation of new scholars. \n\nKing Seongjong invited these Sarim scholars and their followers to the capital. There they served in the Three Offices near the king, and challenged the established order of officials. \n\nOver time, a mix of scholarly conflicts and purges would divide the Sarim into sub-factions, and their conflicts had strong influence on not just Korean intellectual life, but the king himself."

 fee_KOR.7.d: "Jeongsun was a wealthy provincial lady before being chosen as the king's new Queen consort in 1757. She quickly made an impression at court, and became known for her wit and skill as an orator.\n\nMore than four decades later, following multiple other kings, she became regent for the young King Sunjo, as she held seniority over everyone else in the palace. In that role she pushed for the Catholic Persecution of 1801, where Korean catholics were persecuted and killed or banished.\n\nFollowing years of rule, Jeongsun willingly gave up the power once the king came of age in 1804."

 fee_KOR.8.t: "The Silhak Movement"
 fee_KOR.8.d: "The Silhak Movement was a long-term direction of thought, spanning centuries of Korean history, from the late 16th century onwards. \n\nSilhaks were hoping to change society to get away from the extreme metaphysical nature of Neo-Confusianism, which held little correspondence to the life of Koreans in a quickly changing world.\nThe Silhak movement's supporters wanted to change Korean society to match changes in other areas of life. They pushed for land reforms, stronger focus on Korean national identity, and the abandonment of the rigid Confusian societal structure.\nThese changes were meant to come by through a more realistic and experimental approach to social problems, with the consideration of the walfare of the people, and human equality. The Silhak movement is today considered an important step in the creation of a modern Korea."
 fee_KOR.8.a: "I have my doubts, but maybe they can teach us something."
 fee_KOR.9.t: "Silhak Scholars Back Westernisation"
 fee_KOR.9.d: "A number of Silhak scholars in the state apparatus have banded together in agreement over our recent westwards-looking policies. While they see Enlightenment science as a way of evolving their own empirical-based form of Confusianism, westernisation more than anything presents a path to marking out Korea as a historical entity of its own, not quite as tied to the traditions of its neighbors."

 fee_KOR.10.d: "With no naval education, Yi Sun-sin went undefeated in every naval battle he commanded against Japanese invasion forces between 1592 and 1598.\n\nHe is famous for resurrecting and perfecting the design of the Korean turtle ships, giving him an edge in battle. His fleet would frequently be outnumbered, but thanks to his brilliant strategies and quick thinking he always came out on top.\n\nHe received a hero's death, being wounded by a bullet in the naval battle that finally forced the Japanese to abandon Korea. Even as he died, he gave his last order, to not announce his death and let the war drums keep beating. The Koreans carried the day, and Admiral Yi passed into history as one of the greatest naval commanders of all time."

 fee_KOR.11.t: "The Shipwreck of De Sperwer"
 fee_KOR.11.d: "In 1653, the Dutch trading ship De Sperwer shipwrecked off the coast of Korea on a trading mission to Japan. 36 crew members survived and were taken care of in Korea, although they were not allowed to leave due to Korea's strict anti-foreigner policies.\n\nOne of the surviving sailors was Hendrick Hamel, who stayed a captive in Korea for 13 years. The king expected Hamel and the other sailors to lend their expertise in producing muskets to the military, even though they were not technicians. \n\nIn 1666, after 13 years in captivity, Hamel and some other sailors managed to escape the country and return to the Netherlands with the help of another trading mission in Japan. Once home, Hamel published the first western account of Korea in \"Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653-1666.\""
