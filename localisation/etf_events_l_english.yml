 etf_event_ori.1.d:0 "The Muhammed Ali dynasty of Egypt has long served as loyal vassals to the Sublime Porte. However, broken promises and ignored pleas have soured relations between the two. The patience of Egypt has evidently run thin, as they've now launched a revolt against their overlord."

 etf_event_ori.2.t:0 "A strong Egypt?"
 etf_event_ori.2.d:0 "The Ottomans have for long been considered the sickman of Europe, a declining Empire ready to be toppled at any moment. The Egyptians have seized the moment and declared their independence, causing quite a scramble within the Sublime Porte. While it is in our interests to keep the Ottomans weak, a strong Egypt to replace them would not do. The question of intervention has therefor been brought up, what is our stance on the conflict?"

Subsequently, high ranking generals in the army have demanded that the Tsar abdicate to restore peace and order. However, given the current situation in Russia, finding a replacment Tsar would be nigh impossible meaning the Russian monarchy has reached its end."
 etf_event_rus.0.r:0 "Establish a Provisional Government."
 etf_event_rus.1.t:0 "The Soviets Revolt"
 etf_event_rus.1.d:0 "Liberals in the government naively assumed that simply removing the Tsar would fix all of Russia's issues, not so.

 etf_event_jap.2.r:0 "Hurray!"
 etf_event_jap.3.t:0 "The Shogunate is victorious"
 etf_event_jap.3.d:0 "The Shogun has asserted himself as the foremost authority in Japan. After the Emperor's attemped revolution, he has seen fit to abolish the monarchy altogether and replace it with a military dictatorship of the samurai."

 etf_event_jap.4.t:0 "Westernisation"
 etf_event_jap.4.d:0 "Following the Emperors restoration, he has grown increasingly worried over the influence of foreign powers within Japan. Him and his advisors fear that if Japan doesn't live up to its imperial name, it will be swallowed by an empire that does. Viewing the countries vulnerability to foreign imperialism, it has been debated if the monarchy should continue pursuing the reforms that the Shogunate had started."
 etf_event_jap.4.ra:0 "Modernise the country, by the western model."
 etf_event_jap.4.rb:0 "The reforms ended with the shogun."

 etf_event_xinhai.10.d:0 "The Beiyang Army is the most modernized army in China, and subsequently the most influential. The recent turmoil in the south has them concerned, of course, but some factions of the army seem hesitant to fight the revolutionaries, doubting if quelling the rebellion is even possible. If rumours are to be believed, rebel sympathies within the army isn't rare. This is obviously quite concerning..."

Some have instead opened negotiations with the rebel leaders, in the hope of restoring order via diplomacy.\nUnfortunately for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the writing is on the wall. Support for the monarchy has disappeared not only amongst the peasantry, but now also within the military. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can do nothing but enter exile."
