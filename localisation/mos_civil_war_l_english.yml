 MOS_civil_war.1.d: "In 1389 the prince of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, resulting in his son Vasily I becoming Grand Prince. However Donskoy willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then the successor would be Vasily's brother, Yury Dmitrievich of Zvenigorod. Although Yury posed no direct threat to Vasily I during his reign, problems quickly arised at the beginning of Vasily II's rule. The existing rule of succession outlined that the oldest living brother, which was Yury Dmitrievich, should have received the crown and not Vasily II, who was the son of Vasily I and therefore second in line to the throne. In 1433 Yury staged an invasion of the principality, entering Moscow and declaring himself Grand Prince. But after his sudden death, Vasily II was able to regain control of Moscow and allied himself with Dmitry Shemyaka, a son of Yury Dmitrievich. Coupled with this was the threat of the newly-formed Khanate of Kazan, whose forces laid siege to Moscow in 1439. We may have repulsed the Tatars and taken back control of the throne for now, but we are uncertain as to the future of our nation..."

In his absence, a period of interregnum has casted its shadow over Muscovy - or has it?\n     \nVasily II's close ally, Dmitry Shemyaka has proposed to the nobility still in Muscovite lands that he should rule as regent until Vasily II returns, on the grounds that he has a rightful claim to the Grand Princedom, being descended from Yury Dmitrievich. However, the existing nobility are torn between support for both Vasily II and Dmitry Shemyaka. Some supporters of Vasily II argue that this could be detrimental to the existing line of succession, even though he has been loyal to us so far."
