 ugra.1.d: "In 1237, the ferocious Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' commenced with the Battle of the Kalka River. The mighty Batu Khan, grandson of Temüjin and founder of the Golden Horde, led a sweeping campaign of pillage and destruction through the Rus' lands, destroying many great cities and the neighboring civilizations of Cumania and Volga Bulgaria. By 1242, all the Rus' lands owed allegiance to the Great Khan.\nIn the last century though, our hold over the principalities Rus' has weakened. The power of $COUNTRY$ has declined, and with it the ability to keep the northern princes in check. Muscovy has become the greatest of the domains to emerge from the Rus' lands, and their preeminence has become a threat to the continuation of our way of life. For the sake of our own security, the Muscovite threat must be dealt with."

The growth of our power has apparently become a threat to the khans of the $FROMCOUNTRY$, who now look upon us with fear and apprehension. As a result, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now demands that we pay it tribute, or otherwise its warriors will once again fall upon our cities, like those who came before them. The armies of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ are now amassed on the banks of the Ugra River, scarcely more than a stone's throw away from our own."
