Her interests laid in the Ukraine and the lands where the Magnates could rule armies of serfs levied from their vast agricultural estates.\n\nThis was the first disagreement between King Sigismund III and the Nobility.\n\nAnother one was the matter of the religious freedom. The king never stopped working towards making the Catholic Faith the official religion in the country. However he was quite unsuccessful.\n\nThe last disagreement was about Royal power. Sigismund was the grandson of the strong Swedish king Gustavus Wasa and he desired absolutism. Sigismund fought an uneven fight, but his struggle irritated the Poles so much that his reputation is tarnished to this very day. He also managed to upset people with his undiplomatic efforts to increase his power and because of that the Zebrzydowski rebellion stopped his effort for good.\n\nAdmist these rebellions somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 Jews died."
