It is the female dynasties which determine the fate of our children; their group, life, spirit, breath, and pulse. The female brings life and form to the child, and the male locates a spirit to bring for the unborn child. While other tribes would scorn the efforts of the females, we know it is from them that our social class and family is determined, and it is only right that they share a place in power with their male counterparts."

Purrukapali, distressed by what had happened, picked up the dried corpse of his boy and carried him to the wise Japara who promised to restore the boy to life in time, but Purrukapali in a fit of distress and impatience engaged Japara in a great battle. Purrukapali picked up the dead body of his son and carried him into the sea, proclaiming that death should come to all creation so that all would experience the grief he feels. The site where he carried his son became a strong whirlpool that would drown anyone who came near it. Japara, who ended Purrukapalis madness, was reincarnated into the moon and became trapped in a cycle of death and reincarnation every three days."

Marriage is as important to our livelihood as fishing, farming, and foraging, and a Tiwi woman who is unmarried is simply idle and belligerent. Remarriage is common for our people, and often lower members of society such as low-ranking hunters would often marry the widows of more successful men. Remarriage must happen quickly, for each day a woman remains unmarried is a day of great shame."

 aborig_walkabout_desc:0 "The traditional Aboriginal Walkabout is a ceremony in which an Aboriginal boy is expected to journey across the harsh Australian wilderness to a holy site such as Uluru, and it is on his journey that he transitions from boy to man. The journey can last as long as six months, and in this time, the man is expected to live out in the wilderness without any outside assistance. It is a hard passage to go through, but it ensures that only the strongest amongst us survives."
 aborig_outback:0 "People of the Outback"
 aborig_outback_desc:0 "The Outback is a harsh unforgiving place. Even today, many areas of the outback are almost completely uninhabited and venturing there is seen as a death sentence. But, nonetheless, the Aboriginals were able to survive in such harsh conditions and even make lives for themselves out there."
 aborig_sacred:0 "The Sacred Lands"
 aborig_sacred_desc:0 "The Aboriginal religious beliefs often assign divine significance to all places in Australia. Notable landmarks and features across the continent are often described as being the resting places for the gods, or relics of ancient conflicts that took place during the Dreamtime. The Rainbow Serpent, which is often seen as a creator god, is claimed to be the bringer of rain, and when a rainbow appears in the sky, it is the rainbow serpent moving from one watering hole to another."
 aborig_dreamtime:0 "ËºXÖÜÂ"
 aborig_dreamtime_desc:0 "The Dreamtime refers to the time before the creation of the universe; when all that existed were spirits and gods. Different tribes have differing explanations for what brought the world into existence from the Dreamtime, but almost all tribes in Australia believed in this time before material existence. To practice meditation or worship of gods and ancestors is often described as Dreaming, and tapping into the knowledge of the Dreamtime scape. This is because in the Dreamtime, ones entire ancestry exists as one, and the knowledge of your ancestors is readily available in the Dreamtime if one is able to access it."
 aborig_music:0 "Musical Tradition"
 aborig_music_desc:0 "Aboriginal music is distinctly unique in its composition. The digeridoo is a traditional instrument used in Aboriginal music, and prior to the arrival of the colonists, Australia would be the only place one could hear the tones of this unique instrument.

 EOR_protect:0 "Protect the Ancestral Land"
 EOR_protect_desc:0 "The Aboriginal people of Sydney were stoic defenders of their homeland and would resist the offenses of foreign invaders against their land, even against their own self-interest. In many wars and conflicts which have come to the shores of Australia, Eora men and women would eagerly volunteer to fight and defend their land; even during times when they were seen as second-class citizens. Its our willingness to fight and defend the sacred land which rallies new generations constantly to our cause."

Even whales and fur seals would occasionally wander to Palawan shores and bring with them the great bounty of their meats, bone, and fur.

Moinee was the architect of the world; forming land and rivers of our island, and finally taking the wandering spirit of Parlevar and granting him the body of the first man. What followed shortly after was the Kangaroo, which Moinee made in Parlevars image, who then emerged from the soil in the ground. Droemerdene took the form of a star and acted as humanitys guide and transformed these kangaroo-men into human beings; removing their tales and fashioning knees so they may rest. The original human beings were Palawa, and hence any who resist the Palawa identity are merely denying their ancestors."
 PLW_writers:0 "First Aboriginal Writers"

It tells of a hero from Hawaiki who set off on a voyage with his wife Kuramarotini in her great canoe, Matawhourua. On their legendary voyage they encountered countless sea monsters, demons, and harsh weathers before discovering the incredible land of Aotearoa. Upon returning to Hawaiki, he told his people of the incredible things he saw, and that a new life waited for them on these distant shores. It is from these enraptured listeners that we are descended, and the voyager spirit is something that exists at the very heart of our people."

One who practices this tradition is Kaitiaki or guardian and is a sacred guardian who defends the inanimate forces of Mana that surround us but are incapable of defending themselves. To desecrate a holy site is considered equivalent to murder in Maori society, so harmful acts such as polluting a river, chopping down a forest, or excessively plundering natural resources are considered sin without measure. It is only by living in harmony with our environment and restricting ourselves on how much we encroach on nature is the only way to please the Gods and grow rich with Mana."

Kaumatua holds the soul of an immortal demi-god who possesses the power of reincarnation, and have existed across countless lifetimes, and may return at any moment to give the family guidance."
 kapa_haka:0 "Kapa Haka"
 kapa_haka_desc:1 "The Kapa Haka is a series of stomps and chants, most comparable to a war-dance. The dance is typically performed by warriors as they approach a battle, as an attempt to bolster friendly morale as well as intimidate their enemies. The dance demonstrates strength and prowess, while belittling the strength and prowess of their enemy."

 pa_defence_desc:0 "A Pa is a Maori village built in a highly defensible position. Similar to European castles, a Pa is constructed to ensure the continued survival of the local people during wartime. Pa are strong and defensive, but inexpensive and can be built and maintained for little more than a standard village, so while our enemies wait and starve outside our gates, we may continue to prosper within the walls of our mighty fortified village."

We mark these tattoos into our skin with chisels, as we are as tough and unmoving as stone, and we welcome the scars they leave behind. To be marked with traditional tattoos is a sign of great strength and prestige, and causes the weak foreigners to tremble as we charge towards them; our faces blessed by the markings of our gods and ancestors."

 maori_king_desc:1 "In 1858, by popular demand, a Maori king was elected to represent, but not rule over, all other Iwi. Though some rejected the authority of this democratically selected King, many Maori flocked to the King's cause as a way of preventing the alienation of Maori land by the British colonists. Just as Victoria ruled over all the Brits, this king would rule over all the Maori and allow equal negotiations with the Europeans with a unified voice."

 fijian_conjoined_desc:0 "It has been said that Fijian society and religion are conjoined, and that any attempt to separate the two would result in irreparable damage to them both. While the separation of church and state may sound progressive in theory, in reality the very laws which govern our daily lives come from the wisdom of the great prophets and the Gods. While we accept cultures different from our own, if these people are to live here, they must come to understand our Gods and spirits if they are to call themselves Fijian."

The Waqa Drua is the largest and finest seafaring vessel in all the known world, and other kingdoms tremble as they witness our vast ship's approach. Our mastery of ship craft and naval warfare has kept Fiji safe from foreign invaders, and so long as our mighty oceangoing armies maintain our long naval tradition, Fiji shall maintain its sovereignty."

 fijian_warlords_desc:0 "The mountainous nature of our islands have made it difficult to consolidate the different clans together and due to this fragmentation, fights over the territory are a constant thing.

Kai Colo are the mountainous people of Fiji and produce the finest and hardiest warriors our islands have to offer. We do not suffer in the face of adverse climates, and we are adaptable to all terrain. During the war, the Kai Colo held out in their mountainous homes against a foe far more advanced than them. This was a battle that determined the continued existence of the Kai Colo, and unsurprisingly, our superior warriors won out in the end."

This method of granting our people local autonomy promotes local trade and creates a more prospering society for all."

It is the medium by which we preserve our history, our culture, and tell stories of our ancestors and gods. The Oli or Mele describes the events as they happened with words, and the Hula translates those words into physical movement. The movement of our bodies and hands represent the literal words spoken or sung by the Oli and Mele, but also may represent the events of the story such as the flowing of the waves or the intense emotions of the legendary heroes of old."

Our most ancient of ancestors bind all people together, and what better nation to keep the descendants of these people alive than the Tonga?

As Maui continued to fish with this magical hook, he birthed Eua and the many other smaller islands of our great kingdom, and even some of the isles of Fiji and Samoa as well. But it is Tongatapu, the capital island of our nation, that was the first of Maui's islands, and surely the divine nature of our land's birth that will attract even more merchants, settlers, and nobles to our shores."
