The benefits of this chemical process by which the physical properties of natural or synthetic rubber are improved, include a higher tensile strength and resistance to swelling and abrasion, and is elastic over a greater range of temperatures. In its simplest form, vulcanization is brought about by heating rubber with sulfur."

Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy. §R(Social Reforms are now activated)§!"

 vic_flavor_hab.1.d:0 "Engineer of the Austrian peace with Napoleon I through the Emperors marriage with Marie Louise and the conductor of the Concert of Europe, Klemens von Metternich was the dominant statesman of Austria from 1814 until he fled from Vienna in 1848. As Chancellor of State from 1821 to 1848, von Metternich (affectionately known as Fürst Mitternacht) conducted a strict policy of repression across Austria and the German Confederation against anything liberal or nationalistic. Whole heartedly set in the pre-Napoleonic mindset, von Metternich and his associates became the icon of conservatism during the first half of the nineteenth century until the revolutions of 1848 forced the prince to flee Vienna disguised as an old woman."
