But we were wrong. The people we've met just now seems to believe the things that doesn't even exist, and snobbish about the religion they believe in however, their effort to reveal the world seems pretty usuful to us.

Small but many guns could swipe massive army or block the fast-approaching enemy cavarly from crashing into ranks. Big guns on the other hand, could be used to break enemy forts or ships. Handful of grapeshot could work same as many small guns, but costly. Today, the western people gave us the new methods to use big guns. The bouncing cannonball and larger muzzles are effective against all the known enemy. Adapting this will benefit greatly, but it will cost more budget."

With the small scale of the commerce, the need for the loan beyond solvency wasn't needed that much. However, to make economy larger, finance system must be implemented. But there are voices saying it is too risky to apply system.

That was the reason why the basic idea survived throughout the Song-Yuan-Ming dynasty. But time for the change has come. Western countries seem to have more effective way for commanding the army.

But it comes to mind, the cost of the fascinating products are kind of overvalued since it only came from the western merchants. The price is their call, and is steadly climbing each time when the ports are opened. The monopoly is causing rip-off of the products they bring in. It could be stopped when we embrace their technology. But there is other solution. By placing slight tariff, we can compensate the loss from the trade."

However, the news from the far-east diocese flew into the pope's ears\nThere were many people volunteered to believe in the faith of the Christianity, without the missionary sent. Although they violated the church law by assigning the Bishop and the priests by themselves, it was a mistake by ignorance. Now they are asking a priests to guide them.

The Jesuits who mostly handle the upper class reports that the rituals they conduct is reverent ritual. One of the way to remember ancestors and the heroic souls. The Dominico and Franciscan Orders, who mostly meet the low class are refuting that the ritual is obsence and more pagan. The balance of the two sides are tight.

Starting from the existence of the God, reasons for his actions, comparing Christianity with Confucianism ideas... Even the customs of the European world were subjected for debate. Bishop tried to answer all the questions, but he was reletively young and inexperienced to match the old and veteran bureaucrats and scholars of the Far-east. When he was outmatched, they battered him mentally, extracting all the knowledge he had. Now, the Korean scholars are coming to the Saint Peter's Basilica to challenge us. Famous scholars from all over Europe is gathering at Rome to 'Greet' them.\nIn the [GetYear], horde of Korean scholars arrived at the port of Napoli. They risked to send one of the most intelligent and skilled scholars dispite of the harsh waves. After three days, The debate took in the Saint Peter's Square. The rules were simple. A deathmatch dual debate until one couldn't answer the opponent's question.\nIt was brutal and devastating. As the time passed, elite professionals fell from each side one by one, and there were brightest one left from the both side. In the end, they called for a peace. They knew this fight will never come to a conclusion or so. They shook hands and paid respect to the knowledge they had.\nNow, the Far-east knowledge gained from this event will spread to europe.

Now, the enlightened monarchs and the advisors are planning to embrace the administration system from us. \nConfucicus said, 'Not betray the hearts of the ones, who come forth to seeketh the enlightenment, with a cloth in his hands.' in his words. To upkeep that quote, we must invite them in our government division and give them an experience on the high-effecient administration.

 ME_Korea_Events.69.d: "Since the industrial renovation of the state, we've chartered the produced goods to the local nobles or gentries. With the bureaucrat's well planned prediction, the production was optimezed to the maximum level. But this made the capital owners to monopolize the industry, growing into the big blob. Although we have the control over them for now, because we were funding the industry from the beginnig however, could we keep the chains that restricts their lust for profits in the near future? The middle sized merchants who don't have peerage are starting to buy genealogy from economically fallen Yangban houses already. If these things happen more often, We'll definitely lose control."

 ME_Korea_Events.70.d: "When the Yuan collapsed, the international trade followed as well. This caused hyper inflation and deflation on the economy that relied on. To prevent the catastrophic economy disaster, countries in the east strictly restricted the commerce. Only the licensed called Sijeon could put a foot in the flow of gold.\nHowever, recent news tells us that the new merchant factions that insists free trade is forming. They are supported by the who accumulated capital through chartered goods production. Some of the scholars say that's heretic for those families to intervene in the merchant matters. If we back one, the other will be angered."

 ME_Korea_Events.72.d: "The mediation of the [Root.Monarch] made things uneasier for the unlicensed merchants. What they needed utmost was the strong support of the king itself, but king does not seem to intervene deeply. This made the merchants to feel anxious on their status. Without the king's support, the law breakers would have to face the power of the government on by themselves. This raised a question to form a coalition against the Sijeon alliance."
 ME_Korea_Events.72.a: "They call themselves Sasang."
 ME_Korea_Events.73.t: "The Group Fight at the Capital"
 ME_Korea_Events.73.d: "The tensions are rising among the two merchant groups. The Sijeon uses clergy's power to enforce the law, the Sasang used the favors stacked by Jaebeols to avoid the crackdown or evade punishments. This hide and seek continued for a while, until Sasang's influence on the capital grew too much to handle easily for Sijeon. This has led Sijeons to use last resort of resolving the problem, the physical means. The leaders of Sasang on the other hand, won't stand this kind of treatment. If they disregard this problem, the coalition will break apart. Leaving them at vulnerable positions to be defeated one by one. So, the gang fight happend inside the city's walls.

Sasang approached to this manufactory by investing huge amount of money to diversify the supply route to prepare for the upcoming trade war. However, the joint owner of this manufactory agreed to stop the supply of goods to Sasang by signing a deal to Sijeon. These two contracts were signed and was on effect almost at the same time.

And the distribution network for the supply of goods were caught in flames of the conflict. Sijeon claims the Logistics must be in their favor, since they are the only legit force in the major markets. Sasang on the other hand, argues that monopolization of the distribution would make them wither. It's time for government to settle things."

During the past time, no one dared answer the question of his descendent. However, with the numerous academic factions inspired from the new ideas, the question that was tabooed to ask publicly is rising. Is it right to serve a king who killed his nephew to fulfil his lust for the power? If it is not why does he have right to dominate us?\nYou try to stop this murmur from growing into roar of the people, but it seems too late for preventing. Now the word is spreading among every bureaucrats and the topic is expressed indirectly in the Gyeongyeon through quoting the ancient event.

With this circumstances, it is clear that the literati factions are involved in incitement of this matter. We could intentionally root the opposite faction for silencing the voices raised, but it would harm the reason for what has been keeping the factionalism throughout the dynasty.

Also, with conceding the great faults made by forefather, it has given a sign to the numerous factions that the time has come for them to propose reforms they think as rightious. The confucianism ideal makes those factions to try their best to get a seat in the government.

Why should they be treated more speacial then any others, when they even statecraft themselves? The new wave of philosophy from west give us the answer for this. Perhaps we should embrace their idea to reform the society."
 ME_Korea_Events.84.a: "They are too radical ideas."
 ME_Korea_Events.84.b: "Follow the current trend."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.t: "Question of Nobi"
 ME_Korea_Events.85.d: "There has been numerous dispute for the nobi. Some say it is the path of the enlightenment, others say that it is evil custom to leave it. The Yangbans who has lot's of nobi in his hand strongly opposes this reform, and will likely to revolt since they will lose economic powers. However, all the indirect effort to reduce the numbers of nobi class seem to pay off. There are small numbers of nobi left in the country. If we push harder, the people in chains will be freed with slighter less cost then we expect."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.a: "Confucicus said, people belong in their stance."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.b: "We must get rid of what distorts the fundamental idea!"
 ME_Korea_Events.86.t: "Military Modernization"
 ME_Korea_Events.86.d: "The military ideas that western people has seems more fascinating as we study their achievements in those area. We tried to embrace those ideas earlier, and seem to have work fine with us. Today, we heard that western people has made more progress. But the difference between the former and current western idea is similarity of what we had. This new method is far more different. If we sought to integrate and adapt these, it will take total reconstruction of the military system we have. The resistance against our attempt will be humongous."
 ME_Korea_Events.86.a: "It's too costly."
 ME_Korea_Events.86.b: "There is no exeption."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.t: "Realizing Currency"
 ME_Korea_Events.87.d: "Since we minted the Sangpyeongtongbo, it has functioned as the means of the trade. It hasn't been a problem for a while due to the small users however, as time passed, the Circulation of coin stacked up too much, resulting the inflation. This has caused the problem in daily life. To buy a horse, you'll need a crate of coins to bring with. And the increase in the copper consumption made the raw material price to grow, lowering the seigniorage. It could be solved by minting out higher value coins and collecting the coins we have minted. But this decision could cause long term inflation and a forgery crimes to spike for a short period."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.a: "We already minted too much."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.b: "It's a cost to take."
 ME_Korea_Events.88.t: "Gongjo Expansion"
 ME_Korea_Events.88.d: "Through out time, Gongjo was the least wanted department in the government. The ceremonial rank of the department was the lowest, and poorly budgeted dispite of the tasks and responsibility they bear. However, recent influx of innovative engineering and technological knowledge, it has come to a time for to expand this sector into huge division. If we act now, we could easily catch up the western country's technological level. But it woud drastically drain our coffers."
 ME_Korea_Events.88.a: "Why should we bear financial problem for the third rank?"
 ME_Korea_Events.88.b: "The future lies in the engineering!"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.t: "Tax Modernization"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.d: "One of the problem we had all those year was the tax problem. We tried to alleviate the burden put to the peasants and commons while increasing government budget. But those effort was ironically counterfired by putting more burden to them. The source of the problem was all of our attempts were changes within the governmental ideology system. If we really want to lessen the strain we've put to them, there must be bold movement to take. Abolishing the speacial tax that has been put to the regional products, and full cash payment will save peasants and also enlarge our budget. However, it was one of the force that motivated the people to produce more goods in their place. If we abolish those tax, it could cause production problem for a period."
 ME_Korea_Events.89.a: "It will cause too much CHAOS!"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.b: "We need more budget!"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.t: "Law of Laws"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.d: "The Gyeonggukdaejeon made by former king had the comprehensive, administrative, common law aspect. All the reformed law couldn't wear off the influence of the Grand Code. Although it was seem as advanced during the time when it was first published, now it has become backward system. Even though supplemented laws helped to not get decay so easily, it is definitely certain that it is a object for reform. However, If we reform this law to be advanced once more, it would damage our legitimacy and reduce the absolute power we had."
 ME_Korea_Events.90.a: "How dare you question [Root.GetTitle]'s Authority!"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.b: "Everyone must be ruled by law. No exeptions."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.t: "Means of the People"
 ME_Korea_Events.900.d: "§MThe People's desire is the Heaven's desire. I heard executing the Janjeok, the worthless, in the name of justice, not a kingslayer.§!\nThe words of Mencious is the bottom line of the Confucianism ideas. This quote was written in the one of the reform suggested. When this was adressed in the court, the free-for-all situation suddenly became two sided civil war. One side insisted that the people is the foundation of the country, welfare and the rights of the people must be expanded. The other side refutes by sticking to Confucianism idea, saying without the self-enlightenment, those commons are not that quite different from the barbarians.\nThe debate continued for 7 days, and it didn't seem to stop. Now numerous bar and restaurant's main topic is the reform idea. There has been reports on chairshots, group fight, illigal duel is coming from all over the city. If we don't decide which faction to choose soon, there could be a riot among people."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.a: "The responsibility is the Enlightenment."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.b: "The Nation must ensure the people's desire"
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.t: "The Daybreak"
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.d: "After the meeting with the western people, there has been numerous incidents related to them. Now the time for result has come. One of the crucial part in the Confucianism idea is 'How to Statecraft the knowledge'. We learned new method of viewing this world, embraced it as a valuable, or rejected as petty.\nWhat has become of our state after all of the fuss. Was it worth it? Or it was not."
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.a: "The history from now on will decide."
 ME_Korea_Events.666.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.666.d: "As the literati's intention to check the [Root.GetTitle]'s powers has getting stronger as the time passes. The original design of our government system was the harmony among the king and bureaucrats. But they have crossed the step way over the limits. Their real intention of recent actions are not only to keep the harmony, but lust for puppeting the king for their own interests. It is clear that when the [Root.Monarch] dies, all the bureaucrats will rush for incapacitation of the new [Root.GetTitle]. We must act now and show them the mighty power of the king by purging the faction we were rooting for. It might permanently damage the factionalism system, who cares? The ones who tries to sit on the [Root.GetTitle] must be executed for lese-majesty."
 ME_Korea_Events.666.a: "Kill them, ALL."
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.d: "We purged the head of the faction and other seniors along with. This made the opposite faction in those time to grasp the power. But easier the power was given the less gratitude they show. The newly ascended faction behaives like they siezed the power only by their own."
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.a: "Time to switch powers."
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.d: "The ones who threatened the [Root.GetTitle]'s legitimacy was back with the change of power in the court. Although we crippled them by purging key persons and the executives of the factions, they had no choice to defy the king's authority or the legitimacy anymore. However, as the time passes, their stance is gradually returning to the old rebellious way. Perhaps it's time to show once more what the [Root.GetTitle] means in this land."
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.a: "No powers shall go farther then 10 years!"
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.t: "Major Houses Takes Power"
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.d: "After [Root.GetTitle] death, The authority built was taken away also. The mighy power that monarch had was checked by Saheonbu's Daegwan, Saganwon's Gangwan, Hongmungwan's Gwanwon. But these division were neutralized as the factional literaties were used to enforce the [Root.GetTitle]'s power.\nNow the newly succeeded [Root.Monarch.GetName] is left alone in the court with few loyal bureaucrats, the rest is gritting own teeth for revenge of the fallen teacher. To ensure [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power to function properly, he need the power of the closest reletive, The consort. The consort's family is demanding the transfer of the power for a time to purge all the people who wishes to defy the new [Root.GetTitle]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't seem to have choice to lend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword to them.\nWhich turned out to be madness. The [Root.Consort.GetName] purged all of the bureaucrats and filled the people close to them. Now, the $COUNTRY$ is in the hands of the [Root.Consort.GetName]'s family."
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.a: "What [Root.Monarch.GetName] have done???"
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.t: "Breaking Realm"
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.d: "As the Major families oligopolized the country for themselves, the system that was meant to help the commons are now turning back to them. Few revolts are uprising to show the discontent, but it will make the problem worse."
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.a: "System is Breaking Apart!"
 ME_Korea_Events.6665.t: "Total Breakdown of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6665.d: "As the system was broken apart, The administrating region is reduced to the capital area. The central government don't have enough power to get knowledge of the rural area, exept for handful of major cites. The court is filled with the bureaucrats who bought the exam paper or the rank. Regional government is reaping the peasants for filling their break-even point of the cost they paid to get commissioned. The tax is now imposed to the dead and the young. There is military only in the ledger.\nAll of our achievements is gone in the sands of time."

 KOR_catholic_believers_0.d: "The fascinating technological advance of the western world gave big impression to our people. The only way to catch up to them is to learn what path they walked through, the books they wrote, the root of the idea they have. We've studied the greek philosophy, disassembled it to bits by bits. But that wasn't enough. To fully understand them, we had to study not only roots but also the stem and leaves of the western ideas, the Christianity.\nThough it is not that encouraged to study the theism religion, young scholars took the risk of studing it. While researching the christian idea, one scholar took his feet too deep. He was known as radical man, but when he looked into the light of the God, he realized his true nature. The answer he seeked for his lifetime was in the holy scripture.\nWith his friends and comrades, he quickly formed the theory that would work effectivly on Korean. In few months, many people were swayed by his theory. Now, many people in the region believes Catholic."
 KOR_catholic_believers_1.d: "While studing the westology, a young scholar had fallen asleep. While dreaming, he felt the warmth in his back. Just like cuddle of his mother. He heard whisper in his ear, \n'Wake up, my child. Father has task for you to take. Spread the word of the Father to the People in this land.'\nStartled, he woke up fast, almost crashing his head on the wall. He looked around the room, the warmth from the fireplace was all around. But there was different source of heat from the door. It was almost daybreak however, sun was not even out yet. Curiously, he slowly opened the door. Suddenly, There was a flash of light pouring into his eyes.\nA maiden with robe of rainbow feathers was standing in the middle of light. Scholar rubbed his eyes to see clear, but when he opened his eyes, the strange happening was gone. Mocking himself for seeing the hallucination for the tiredness, he turned back to his house.\nBefore he took the first step, something was caught on his foot. A Wooden Cross. He knew that this thing was placed on the shelf. When he picked up the cross, he could feel the warmth from the flash. With fear and delight, he now know what task is lying ahead."
 KOR_catholic_believers_2.d: "An aged scholar was trailing through the mountain for the imperial examination. It was getting dark, and there was no jumak near by. If the night comes, he'll be most likely to become tiger's lovely meal. Among the tree shadows of the twilight, he saw the flicker of light. Focusing his sight, he could barly see the jumak's roof shape. With gladness, he sped up his pace to get there just in time.\nHow much did he walk? He could smell the kimchi's fermented scent, the fragrance of the bone stew. He was almost there.All of sudden, he felt the goosebumps in his back. A Low growl he knew very well was coming from his flank. Realizing that he was a dead man, he silently recalled his wife and his daughter. Shortly after, he wouldn't be able to see them forever.\nWhen tiger jumped, he closed his eyes. Hoping the quick death from the shock. But after a several heartbeat, the pain or the impact didn't occure. Slowly, he opened his eyes and surprised with astonishment. The tiger was kneeling infront of the beautiful woman, emitting holy aura and gentle light. She turned to the scholar smiled and said, 'Don't be afraid. Father always watches over his lambs.'.\nWhen the woman patted the tiger, that beast slowly turned and ran to the dark forest. After that miracle, she shimmered into the thin air, leaving the jade embedded cross necklace. When scholar picked up that treasure, he suddenly remembered the Daniel's story. The exam didn't matter for him anymore. God is with him now."
 KOR_catholic_believers_3.d: "The dispute for the reservoir rights has risen between two towns. Normally, this kind of dispute would be resolved through seokjeon, but the love-triangle for the femboy and political blunder made by local governor made the strife to spike high. A local humble man tried to postpone the regular seokjeon, yet, blinded by rage, none would listen. The night before, he secretly wrote a report to the governor about the huge tension and pleading to stop them.\nHe prepared the night ride to the government office. When blew off the lamp, the dark fell into the room. But then, a cross he was keeping in his house shimmered with holy light. Unconsiously, he grabbed the cross. Then, the maiden in robe of feathers appeared to him and gave revelation.\n\n'Stand in the middle of the fight, and everything will be solved.'\nMysterious maiden disappeared just with that quote, but the lamp he blew out was lit again. While riding back and forth through night ride, he tought about the words he heard.\nWhen the sun rose, people from each town gathered with rocks, A club and shield in their hands, sling on the belt, eyes filled with hatred. The regional guards are not yet reached.\nLeaders met in the middle, ultimatum was annouced with the terms from each. Of course, it wasn't unagreeable to both. They returned to the base and horn blew. The rocks flew to each side, and the phalanx marched foward. That was when humble man walked to the right center of mayhem. He instictively kneeled down, both hands put together. The rocks that had less energy dropped down to him. It was obvious his head would be smashed. But then, the light from the sky shone upon him. The rocks in the air lost the power and dropped to the ground. When the miracle shook the crowd in awe, the maiden from the last night gradually descended, riding the light. Everyone at the area lowered their head.\nWhen the will to fight was gone, maiden smiled and ascended to the sky, withdrawing the light. The leaders from each side came to the center again and asked man how to solve the problem. He answered with rational and mutual acceptable terms."
