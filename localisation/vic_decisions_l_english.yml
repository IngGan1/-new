He is most famous for submitting the Dreyse needle gun in 1836 to the Prussian army, which was adopted for service in December 1840 as the Leichte Perscussions-Gewehr M 1841  a name deliberately chosen to mislead about the rifle's mechanism."

 corn_laws_desc:0 "As a means of promoting local produce, the British government implamented high tariffs on the import of food and grain (generalized as corn). These laws sought to generate large profits for landowners, and increase their political power in Britain. Yet despite the political benefits gained by the nobility, the Corn Laws hindered the growth of other businesses, particularly industry. The Laws also raised the standard of living for the non-aristocrats, and would directly exacerbate the Great Potato Famine in 1845. The Laws would not be repealed until 1846."

 north_german_confederation_nation_desc:0 "The North German Confederation was the German federal state which existed from July 1867 to December 1870. The federal constitution established a constitutional monarchy with the Prussian king as the bearer of the Bundespraesidium, or head of state. Laws could only be enabled with the consent of the Reichstag (a parliament based on universal male suffrage) and the Federal Council (a representation of the states). During the four years of the North German Confederation, a conservative-liberal cooperation undertook important steps to unify (Northern) Germany with regard to law and infrastructure."

 austrian_empire_nation_desc:0 "On 24 March 1803, the Imperial Recess was declared, which reduced the number of ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire from 81 to only 3 and the free imperial cities from 51 to 6. This measure was aimed at replacing the old constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, but the actual consequence of the Imperial Recess was the end of the empire. Taking this significant change into consideration, the German Emperor Francis II created the title Emperor of Austria, for himself and his successors."
