Following His command, we marked our lintels and doorposts with a lamb's blood, so that the Angel of Death would pass over them and not kill our firstborns. Since then, we have lived free from the shackles of the Pharaoh, but we must still remember it and thank the Lord for it.\nThis is what we celebrate on Pesach, one of the three Shalosh Regalim, but we must celebrate while keeping that in mind. Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating. The sacrificial lamb must be offered, and all leaven discarded and burned. With this, our people will remember."

Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating.\nShavuot also commemorates the wheat harvest after the counting of the Omer started at Passover. Thus, it represents the anticipation and desire of receiving the Torah and we must celebrate while keeping that in mind. We must focus on the study of the Torah to become a nation committed to serving the Lord. Only then will the Lord provide."

Although it was customary for the Shalosh Regalim to consist in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple, that's not possible anymore since the destruction of the Second Temple. Thus, we must make an effort to remember while celebrating.\nBy building and living in temporary dwellings during Sukkot we partake in the hardships our people had to suffer in the past, and we remember. And by partaking in all this shared suffering our people will be aware that we have more things in common than those that make us apart."

According to the Jewish law, until now [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] was the responsibility of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but from now on [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will be held accountable for [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own actions.\nIt has always been tradition among Jews that when boys reach 13 and girls 12, they become full members of the community with the responsibilities that come with it. They can already be called to read the Torah, lead and participate in the prayer quorum, and have the right to marry. But they also have the obligation of knowing the Jewish law and abide by it.\nIt is expected of us to host a party to celebrate such occasion. It will also be the perfect opportunity to present [Root.Heir.GetName] to the court, and for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to strengthen [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] bonds with it, preparing [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] for when [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has to start ruling our nation."

 jewish_flavor.5.d:0 "Jerusalem belongs to our people once more and the majority of its population worships the Lord again. It is a good opportunity to fulfill the dream that millions of Jews have had since the Second Temple was destroyed during the Roman siege of Jerusalem.The new Temple will be even greater than the previous one. \nThere is a problem though, the Temple Mount where the successive Temples have been erected is now home to the Al Aqsa compound and therefore holy to the Muslims. Should we build the Temple in its original position, we would need to demolish the Al Aqsa compound and enrage Muslims. We could reuse the materials though, which would make our project much cheaper. On the other hand, should we build it in another location, rabbis will be really displeased because we chose a non sacred place and renounced to a millenary believe.\nWhat should we do?"

 jewish_flavor.6.d:0 "Judaism is a non proselytizing religion and, therefore, it is rather difficult to bring new blood to our small community. To add to this, according to our tradition, only children born to Jewish women are Jewish themselves, which makes it dangerous for our people to allow inter religious marriages if the bride belongs to our religion.\nThankfully, people from [Root.GetName], previously following other Abrahamic religions, have realized that they believed in the Lord all the time and have fully embraced their Jewishness."
