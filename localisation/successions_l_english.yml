However, the deal was that in order to secure the payment, Hungary would hand over 16 Spia towns to Poland. This area, known as Starostwo Spiskie, with its capital in Lubowla would then be given back on the event of repaying the loan. Since then Sigismundus had tried many times to bring Lubowla back to Hungary, but he didn't have the money. Now, after all these years, the time has come to settle the issue once again."

 succession.1.d:0 "Since ages, the rules of inheriting have stayed the same in the House of Griffins. If there are several brothers to inherit, the country is split among them on their father's death. However, the second part of the law says that on the event of extinction of a male line of one of the brothers his part goes to one of the other lines. This way, the divisions don't last too long. Even though this law isn't too useful, it is our tradition."
