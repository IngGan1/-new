 borgia.1.d: "In 756, the Frankish king Pepin the Great, who had been campaigning in the lands of the Lombard Kingdom, made the Donation of Pepin to the nascent State of the Church. Through the Donation of Pepin, the Pope greatly expanded his temporal authority, gaining dominion over the Romagna, the Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis of the Adriatic Coast. In times since then however, many of these territories have broken away from papal control, and are now under the rule of petty sovereigns who only pay lip service to the authority of the Pope.\nRecently, a man by the name of Cesare Borgia mysteriously arrived in Rome from abroad. Reputedly a great statesman and military leader, Cesare Borgia is said to have led many mercenary armies to impressive victories as a seasoned condottiero, and is now in Rome to serve the Pope and the faith. According to a rumor though, he is supposedly some illegitimate relation of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$...\nWhatever Borgia's connections may be, he has expressed that he is more than willing to assist the Papal States in reacquiring control of the lands of central Italy. As long as we are willing to provide him with financial and military aid, he says, he will conquer these territories for the Papacy."

However, the beginning of the Italian wars and foreign intervention in peninsular affairs after 1490 led many of the condottieri to abandon the service of the Italian city-states, instead taking up contract with far greater powers like Spain and France."
